# 🗣️ *Gathering the Suspects*

You step into the drawing room, where the guests have assembled, draped in evening wear and unease. There are **seven** of them, but two in particular draw your attention:

**Lady Cassandra Marlowe** – Sir Reginald's niece, recently cut from the will. Her beauty is only matched by her bitterness.

**Mr. Elric Doyle** – The business partner, whose dealings with Sir Reginald have grown sour over the last few months.

Each has motive. But only one may have had the opportunity.

Who do you question first?
