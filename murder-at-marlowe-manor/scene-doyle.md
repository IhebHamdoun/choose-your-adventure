# 👨‍💼 *The Business Partner*

Mr. Doyle is pacing in the conservatory, wiping sweat from his brow with a monogrammed handkerchief. "Reginald was planning to force me out of the company," he admits. "But I didn’t kill him. I was in the billiards room all night, working on a whisky and a three-ball combo."

No one saw him there. You recall seeing no recent chalk marks on the cues either.

You also remember Sir Reginald mentioned Doyle was under **investigation for embezzlement**.
