# ðŸ“š *A Fictional Alibi*

The fireplace in the library is cold. One book lies open on a side table, but dust has settled on the cushion next to it.

A muddy footprint stains the rug near the open window.

Lady Cassandraâ€™s alibi doesn't hold. But the window here leads straight to the garden â€” the same garden where you found that blue silk.

Someoneâ€™s weaving lies. Or maybe multiple someones.
