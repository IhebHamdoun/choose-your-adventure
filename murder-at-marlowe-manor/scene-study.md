# üîç *A Locked Room*

You enter the study. The air is thick with pipe smoke and rain-dampened wood. Sir Reginald slumps over his mahogany desk, a broken wine glass near his hand, its contents spilled onto a blotter.

The room is undisturbed ‚Äî no broken furniture, no overturned objects. Except‚Ä¶ a faint set of **scratches along the inner window frame**, almost too deliberate to be random. You also notice the latch appears **damaged**, as though it was forced from the outside.

His lips are tinged blue. A quick glance confirms your suspicion: **poison**.
