# ðŸ”° *The Arrival*

It is a stormy Friday evening in the English countryside. Lightning dances across the sky as your car crunches up the gravel drive of **Marlowe Manor**. The house, an imposing stone estate with ivy-covered walls, looms through the rain like a watchful eye.

You are **Detective Evelyn Blake**, invited under mysterious circumstances by the wealthy patriarch **Sir Reginald Marlowe**, who claimed in a letter that his life was in danger.

The butler greets you stiffly and leads you to your room. Hours later, the house is shaken by a scream.

Sir Reginald has been found **dead in his study â€” door locked from the inside, windows latched, and no obvious signs of struggle.**

The guests are already whispering. Someone in this house is a killer.

What do you do?
