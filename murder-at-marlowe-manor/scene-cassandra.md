## 👩‍🦰 *The Bitter Niece*

Lady Cassandra lounges in the drawing room, cigarette in hand, eyes rimmed red. She claims to have been **reading in the library** all evening — alone.

Her black gloves, you note, are speckled with **mud**.

"I didn't even speak to Uncle tonight," she says, voice trembling. "We haven't exactly been on good terms since he changed the will. But murder? Please."

Her alibi is shaky at best. Her demeanor seems less of sorrow, and more of strategy.
