# ðŸŒ¿ *Among the Roses*

The footprints lead you to the **greenhouse**, damp with condensation and filled with exotic plants. You spot a **blue silk scrap** caught on a thorn and a **cufflink** half-buried in the mud.

Initials are engraved on the cufflink: **E.D.** â€” Elric Doyle.

Thereâ€™s also a fresh footprint in the soil, smaller than Doyleâ€™s foot, and distinctly heeled â€” perhaps a womanâ€™s.

This wasnâ€™t just one visitor.
